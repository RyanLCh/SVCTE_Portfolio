# SVCTE Portfolio

This is a portfolio of the work I have done while enrolled in the Silicon Valley Career Technical Education institution's Mobile App Design & Computer Coding course in 2020-2021. For the main page, open ==index.html== to open a small compilation of websites I have created in the course. In the websites, use the left and right navigation arrows to browse through the compilation and the waffle icon to go back to the index page. All code and designs were made by me unless otherwise stated in the code or the copyright.
